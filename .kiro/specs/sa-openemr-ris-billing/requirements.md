# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a world-class OpenEMR-based Radiology Information System (RIS) and medical billing platform specifically tailored for the South African healthcare market. The system must integrate seamlessly with South African medical aid schemes, comply with local healthcare regulations (POPIA, HPCSA), and provide real-time connectivity with the Healthbridge clearing house. This is a critical component of the Ubuntu Patient Sorg medical software suite that must demonstrate professional-grade functionality and compete with established healthcare software providers.

### Requirement 4: NRPL Billing Code System

**User Story:** As a billing clerk, I want automated NRPL (National Reference Price List) billing code calculation, so that I can ensure accurate pricing and maximize reimbursements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a radiology procedure is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the correct NRPL code and current tariff

5. WHEN procedures have multiple billing options THEN the system SHALL recommend the most appropriate NRPL code based on clinical context

### Requirement 5: Patient Management and Workflow

**User Story:** As a radiology technologist, I want comprehensive patient management with workflow tracking, so that I can efficiently manage patient flow and ensure no studies are missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient arrives THEN the system SHALL display their complete medical history, current orders, and insurance status
2. WHEN studies are completed THEN the system SHALL automatically update patient status and notify relevant staff
3. WHEN appointments are scheduled THEN the system SHALL check for conflicts and optimize scheduling based on equipment availability
4. WHEN urgent studies are ordered THEN the system SHALL prioritize them in the workflow and send immediate notifications
5. WHEN patients have special requirements THEN the system SHALL display alerts and preparation instructions

### Requirement 6: Real-time PACS Integration

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want seamless integration with the PACS system, so that images are automatically available for reporting without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DICOM images are received THEN the system SHALL automatically match them to the correct patient and study order
2. WHEN image-patient mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL alert users and prevent incorrect associations
3. WHEN studies are complete THEN the system SHALL automatically update study status in both RIS and PACS
4. WHEN images are viewed THEN the system SHALL track access for audit purposes
5. WHEN studies are reported THEN the system SHALL automatically link reports to DICOM images

### Requirement 7: Financial Reporting and Analytics

**User Story:** As a practice manager, I want comprehensive financial reporting and analytics, so that I can monitor practice performance and identify revenue optimization opportunities.
