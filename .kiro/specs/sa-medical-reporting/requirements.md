# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The South African Medical Reporting Module is a comprehensive reporting system designed specifically for South African radiology practices. This module integrates seamlessly with existing RIS (Radiology Information System) and PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) infrastructure while supporting the unique South African medical workflow that includes doctor dictation, transcriptionist review, doctor authorization, and medical aid billing. The system must be extremely user-friendly, work offline-first, and comply with POPI Act requirements while supporting local billing codes and medical aid claim formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Voice Dictation and Speech-to-Text Integration

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a doctor completes dictation THEN the system SHALL automatically route the draft report to the transcriptionist queue
2. WHEN a transcriptionist opens a report for review THEN the system SHALL display the original audio alongside the transcribed text
3. WHEN transcriptionists make corrections THEN the system SHALL track all changes with timestamps and user identification
4. WHEN multiple transcriptionists are available THEN the system SHALL distribute reports using round-robin or workload balancing
5. IF a report requires specialized medical knowledge THEN the system SHALL allow routing to specific transcriptionists based on expertise
6. WHEN transcriptionist review is complete THEN the system SHALL route the report back to the originating doctor for authorization

### Requirement 3: Doctor Authorization and Digital Signature

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want to review transcriptionist corrections and digitally authorize my reports so that they become legally valid medical documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a report returns from transcription THEN the system SHALL highlight all changes made by transcriptionists
2. WHEN reviewing changes THEN the doctor SHALL be able to accept, reject, or modify each correction individually
3. WHEN the doctor is satisfied with the report THEN the system SHALL provide a digital signature mechanism
4. WHEN digitally signing THEN the system SHALL require multi-factor authentication for security
5. WHEN a report is authorized THEN the system SHALL timestamp the authorization and make the report immutable
6. IF the doctor rejects transcriptionist changes THEN the system SHALL allow re-dictation or manual editing before authorization

### Requirement 4: PACS and RIS Integration

**User Story:** As a healthcare administrator, I want the reporting module to seamlessly integrate with our existing PACS and RIS systems so that reports are automatically linked to the correct studies and patients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new DICOM study arrives in PACS THEN the system SHALL automatically create a corresponding report entry
2. WHEN creating a report THEN the system SHALL pull patient demographics and study information from the RIS
3. WHEN a report is authorized THEN the system SHALL automatically attach the report to the corresponding DICOM study in PACS
4. IF patient information mismatches between systems THEN the system SHALL flag the discrepancy and require manual verification
5. WHEN accessing images for reporting THEN the system SHALL provide seamless integration with the DICOM viewer
6. WHEN reports are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and sync changes across all integrated systems

### Requirement 5: South African Medical Aid Billing Integration

**User Story:** As a billing administrator, I want the system to automatically generate billing information and medical aid claims so that revenue cycle management is streamlined and compliant with local requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a report is authorized THEN the system SHALL automatically extract billable procedures and diagnoses
2. WHEN generating bills THEN the system SHALL use current South African medical aid tariffs and billing codes (NRPL, ICD-10)
3. WHEN creating claims THEN the system SHALL generate files in formats required by major South African medical aids (Discovery, GEMS, Momentum, etc.)
4. IF billing codes are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL flag the report for billing team review
5. WHEN claims are generated THEN the system SHALL include all required fields for electronic submission
6. WHEN billing is complete THEN the system SHALL update patient records and generate invoices for patient portions

### Requirement 6: Offline-First Operation

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider in areas with unreliable internet, I want the reporting system to work fully offline so that patient care is never interrupted by connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL function completely without internet connectivity
2. WHEN working offline THEN all features including dictation, transcription, and authorization SHALL remain available
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync all changes to central servers
4. IF sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution tools for administrators
5. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL queue all external communications (emails, notifications) for later delivery
6. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL provide data archiving and cleanup tools

### Requirement 7: POPI Act Compliance and Security

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to meet all POPI Act requirements so that patient privacy is protected and the practice remains legally compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing patient data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data at rest using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.3 or higher for all communications
3. WHEN users access the system THEN multi-factor authentication SHALL be required for all clinical users
4. WHEN any data access occurs THEN the system SHALL log user, timestamp, and action for audit purposes
5. WHEN patients request data access THEN the system SHALL provide secure, time-limited access to their own reports
6. IF unauthorized access is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert administrators and lock affected accounts

### Requirement 8: User-Friendly South African Interface

**User Story:** As a South African healthcare worker, I want an interface that understands local terminology, languages, and workflows so that the system feels natural and efficient to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL support English and Afrikaans languages
