# NAS Integration & Advanced DICOM Viewer: Progress & TODO

## Progress Summary

- **Backend foundation**: Flask backend consolidated into single app.py, user DB, NAS connector, and REST endpoints are present.
- **2FA**: Core logic, endpoints, and admin/user flows implemented (see `README_2FA.md`).
- **DICOM Viewer**: React/TypeScript app scaffolded, with core viewing and measurement tools started.
- **Frontend**: Login, admin, user dashboards, and some NAS config UI exist.
- **Import tool**: `nas_importer.py` exists for NAS DICOM import/indexing.
- **Session management**: Single-session logic and endpoints present.
- **Secure link sharing**: Some backend and UI code for secure sharing.
- **Enhanced Device Management**: Medical device discovery with DICOM testing and confidence scoring.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time system statistics and activity monitoring.
- **User Management**: Complete admin interface for user CRUD operations.

## âœ… **COMPLETED - Developer B Tasks**

### Backend Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] **Consolidated Flask Backend** - All endpoints moved to single app.py backbone
- [x] **ðŸ”§ MAJOR REFACTORING (Aug 2025)** - App.py refactored from 1359 lines to modular blueprint structure
- [x] **Enhanced Medical Device Detection** - Advanced network scanning with confidence scoring
- [x] **DICOM Connectivity Testing** - C-ECHO verification for medical devices
- [x] **Admin Dashboard API** - Statistics, activity monitoring, and user management endpoints
- [x] **Device Management API** - Enhanced scan endpoints with medical device classification

### ðŸ”§ **New: Backend Refactoring (Aug 2025)** âœ…
- [x] **Modular Architecture** - Split monolithic app.py into organized blueprints
- [x] **Configuration Management** - Externalized config with environment support
- [x] **Authentication Utilities** - Centralized auth decorators and session management
- [x] **Blueprint Structure** - Separated routes into logical modules:
  - `auth_routes.py` - Authentication endpoints
  - `admin_routes.py` - User management and admin functions
  - `device_routes.py` - Medical device management
  - `nas_routes.py` - NAS integration endpoints
  - `web_routes.py` - HTML page routes
- [x] **Error Handling** - Centralized error handlers and logging
- [x] **Application Factory** - Flask app factory pattern for better testing
- [x] **Backward Compatibility** - 100% API compatibility maintained

### Frontend Web Interfaces âœ…
- [x] **Enhanced Device Management Component** - Medical device detection with DICOM ping functionality
- [x] **Admin Dashboard Component** - Real-time system health, user stats, and quick actions
- [x] **User Management Component** - Complete CRUD interface for user administration
- [x] **Navigation Enhancement** - Role-based navigation with new admin features
- [x] **Responsive Design** - Mobile-optimized components with Tailwind CSS

### Integration & Testing âœ…
- [x] **Component Integration** - All new components integrated into React routing
- [x] **API Testing** - Health checks and endpoint validation completed
- [x] **Authentication Integration** - Session-based auth working across all components
- [x] **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states and user feedback

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Backend
- [ ] Complete user/group management database integration (currently mock data)
- [ ] Finalize secure link sharing (token generation, expiry, audit)
- [ ] NAS connector: error handling, reconnection, advanced config
- [ ] Per-user image access enforcement
- [ ] Audit logging for all admin/user actions
- [ ] Advanced authentication: face recognition, email 2FA
- [ ] Single-session enforcement: test all edge cases
- [ ] **Post-Refactoring**: Add comprehensive unit tests for each blueprint
- [ ] **Post-Refactoring**: Implement service layer pattern for business logic
- [ ] **Post-Refactoring**: Add OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints

### Frontend
- [ ] Complete admin/user dashboards (real-time updates, charts)
- [ ] NAS config/status dashboard, file browser UI
- [ ] DICOM viewer: finish advanced tools (3D, MPR, annotation, export)
- [ ] Secure link sharing UI (generate, copy, email, QR)
- [ ] Session expiration handling (notify user, redirect)
- [ ] Face/2FA UI (enrollment, verification)
- [ ] Localization (English, Afrikaans, isiZulu)

### Docs & Testing
- [ ] Update all READMEs with current status and usage
- [ ] Add user/admin guides (with South African context)
- [ ] Test with real NAS and DICOM datasets
- [ ] Document setup, security, and troubleshooting
