## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my project be reviewed?
Projects are reviewed in the order they are submitted. Typical review time is 24-48 hours.

### Can I resubmit if I update my code?
Yes! You can submit updated versions. Each submission will be tracked separately with its commit hash.

### What if I disagree with my score?
The UCIC process is transparent. You can review the detailed scorecard and rubric. If you believe there was an error, you can request a re-review.

### Is this the official MCP Africa Hackathon ranking?
The UCIC provides independent, transparent validation. This is a community-driven integrity check, not the official hackathon results.

### How do I get my certificate?
Once your project is validated, you'll receive a link to download your official UCIC certificate with QR code and audit trail.
