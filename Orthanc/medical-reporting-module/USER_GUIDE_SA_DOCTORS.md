## 📊 Tips for Maximum Efficiency

### Voice Dictation Best Practices

#### **Speaking Technique**
- 🎤 **Speak naturally** - No need to change your accent
- 📏 **Maintain consistent distance** - 6-8 inches from microphone
- 🔇 **Minimize background noise** - Close doors, turn off fans
- ⏱️ **Speak at normal pace** - Not too fast, not too slow
- 🔤 **Spell difficult names** - "Patient surname spelled J-O-H-A-N-N-E-S"

#### **Structuring Your Dictation**
```
Good example:
"Clinical information: 35-year-old female with chest pain.
Findings: The heart size is normal. The lungs are clear bilaterally.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Impression: Normal chest radiograph."

Avoid:
"Um, so this is a, let me see, 35-year-old woman, and she has, 
uh, chest pain, and the heart looks okay..."
```

### Workflow Optimization

1. **Start with templates** - Always begin with appropriate template

#### **Time-Saving Tips**
- Use "Normal chest study" for routine normal cases
