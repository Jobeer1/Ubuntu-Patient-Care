## Learning System

### Correction Recording
```python
# Record a correction for learning
engine.record_correction(
    user_id="doctor123",
    original_text="numonia in the lung",
    corrected_text="pneumonia in the lung"
)
```

### Statistics
```python
# Get learning statistics
stats = engine.get_stt_stats("doctor123")
print(f"Total corrections: {stats['total_corrections']}")
print(f"User corrections: {stats['user_corrections']}")
```

## Audio Quality Analysis

### Quality Assessment
```python
from utils.voice_utils import analyze_voice_audio

# Analyze audio quality
audio_data = open("recording.wav", "rb").read()
analysis = analyze_voice_audio(audio_data)

print(f"Quality: {analysis['quality']}")
print(f"Recommendations: {analysis['recommendations']}")
```

### Quality Levels
- **Excellent**: Clear audio, low noise, good volume
- **Good**: Minor background noise, acceptable quality
- **Fair**: Some noise or volume issues, usable
- **Poor**: High noise, low volume, may affect accuracy

## South African Accent Processing

### Accent Variations
```python
from utils.voice_utils import SouthAfricanAccentProcessor

processor = SouthAfricanAccentProcessor()
variations = processor.process_accent_variations("tuberculosis")
# Returns: ["tuberculosis", "tuberkulosis", ...]
```

### Common Patterns
- TH-fronting: "think" ‚Üí "fink"
- R-dropping: "water" ‚Üí "wata"
- Vowel shifts: "kit" ‚Üí "ket"
- Diphthong reduction: "about" ‚Üí "aboot"

## Testing

### Run Voice Processing Tests
```bash
# Simple test (no Whisper required)
python test_voice_simple.py

# Full test suite (requires pytest)
python -m pytest tests/test_voice_processing.py -v
```

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Voice Engine initialization and session management
- ‚úÖ Offline STT engine with medical vocabulary
- ‚úÖ Voice command processing and recognition
- ‚úÖ South African accent processing
- ‚úÖ Medical terminology correction
- ‚úÖ Audio quality analysis
- ‚úÖ Learning engine and corrections
- ‚úÖ API endpoints and error handling

## Performance Optimization

### Offline Processing
- **Model Size**: Use "base" model for balance of speed/accuracy
- **Chunking**: Process audio in 5-second chunks for real-time feel
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used medical terms
- **Threading**: Background processing to avoid UI blocking

### Memory Management
- **Model Loading**: Load Whisper model once at startup
- **Audio Buffering**: Efficient audio data handling
- **Correction Limits**: Keep last 100 corrections per user
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old audio files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Whisper Not Installed
```
Error: OpenAI Whisper not installed
Solution: pip install openai-whisper
```

#### Poor Audio Quality
```
Issue: Low transcription accuracy
Solutions:
- Check microphone positioning
- Reduce background noise
- Increase speaking volume
- Use better quality microphone
```

#### Voice Commands Not Recognized
```
Issue: Commands not executing
Solutions:
- Speak clearly and slowly
- Use exact command phrases
- Check command examples in API
- Verify active voice session
```

#### Database Errors
```
Issue: Cache database errors
Solution: Check write permissions in cache directory
```

### Debug Mode
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Enable detailed logging for voice components
logger = logging.getLogger('services.voice_engine')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Production Deployment

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended for Whisper)
- SSD storage for model files
- Microphone access permissions
- Audio processing libraries

### Configuration
```python
# Production settings
VOICE_CONFIG = {
    'STT_MODE': 'OFFLINE_ONLY',
    'WHISPER_MODEL': 'base',
    'CACHE_SIZE': '1GB',
    'MAX_AUDIO_DURATION': 300,  # 5 minutes
    'CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD': 0.8
}
```

### Monitoring
- Audio processing latency
- STT accuracy rates
- Voice command success rates
- User correction frequency
- System resource usage

## Security Considerations

### Voice Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All voice recordings encrypted at rest
- **Retention**: Automatic deletion after processing
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to voice data
- **Audit Logging**: All voice operations logged

### POPIA Compliance
- User consent for voice processing
- Data minimization principles
- Right to deletion
- Secure data transmission

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Multi-language Support**: Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa
- **Speaker Recognition**: User-specific voice models
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user dictation sessions
- **Advanced Commands**: Complex workflow automation
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud-based learning sync

### Integration Opportunities
- **PACS Integration**: Direct DICOM metadata dictation
- **RIS Integration**: Automated report routing
- **Mobile Apps**: Smartphone dictation support
- **Wearables**: Smart watch voice commands
