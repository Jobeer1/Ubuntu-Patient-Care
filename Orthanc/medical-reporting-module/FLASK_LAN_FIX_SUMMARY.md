# Flask LAN Broadcasting Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Layout Manager Initialization Error
**Problem**: `LayoutManager.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'viewport_manager'`

**Root Cause**: The global `layout_manager` instance was being created without the required `viewport_manager` parameter.

**Solution**: 
- Set the global `layout_manager` to `None` initially
- Modified `service_manager.py` to properly initialize the `LayoutManager` with a `ViewportManager` when needed
- Fixed indentation error in `layout_manager.py`

### 2. Security Service Indentation Error
**Problem**: `unindent does not match any outer indentation level (security_service.py, line 435)`

**Root Cause**: Malformed comment causing indentation issues in the global instance declaration.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed comment formatting in `security_service.py`
- Changed `#\n Global security service instance` to `# Global security service instance`

### 2. Flask LAN Broadcasting Configuration
**Status**: ✅ Already Properly Configured

The Flask app was already correctly configured for LAN broadcasting:
- **Host**: Set to `'0.0.0.0'` in `app.py` (allows external connections)
- **CORS**: Enabled with `supports_credentials=True`
- **SocketIO**: Configured with `cors_allowed_origins="*"`
- **Port**: Configurable via environment variable (default: 5001)

## Files Modified

1. **`services/layout_manager.py`**:
   - Fixed indentation error on line 981
   - Set global `layout_manager = None` instead of instantiating without parameters

2. **`core/service_manager.py`**:
   - Added proper initialization logic for `layout_manager`
   - Creates `ViewportManager` and `LayoutManager` instances when needed

3. **`services/security_service.py`**:
   - Fixed indentation error on line 435
   - Corrected malformed comment in global instance declaration

## How to Run the App

### Basic Usage
```bash
cd medical-reporting-module
python app.py
```

### With Custom Port
```bash
cd medical-reporting-module
set PORT=8080
python app.py
```

### Access URLs
- **Local**: http://localhost:5001
- **LAN**: http://[YOUR_IP]:5001 (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:5001)
- **HTTPS** (if SSL configured): https://localhost:5001

### Find Your IP Address
```bash
# Windows
ipconfig

# Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter
```

## Testing the Fix

Run the comprehensive test script to verify all fixes:
```bash
cd medical-reporting-module
python final_startup_test.py
```

Or run individual tests:
```bash
# Test layout manager fix
python test_layout_fix.py

# Test app startup
python test_app_startup.py

# Fix any remaining indentation issues
python fix_indentation_issues.py
```

## Network Access

The app is now configured to:
- ✅ Accept connections from any IP address on the LAN
- ✅ Handle CORS requests properly
- ✅ Support WebSocket connections from external clients
- ✅ Serve static files and API endpoints to LAN clients

## Security Notes

- The app allows connections from any origin (`cors_allowed_origins="*"`)
- For production use, consider restricting CORS to specific domains
- SSL/HTTPS is recommended for production deployments
- The app includes built-in SSL certificate management

## Troubleshooting

If you still can't access from other devices:
1. Check Windows Firewall settings
2. Ensure the port (5001) is not blocked
3. Verify your network allows inter-device communication
4. Try accessing via IP address instead of hostname
