- **Image Manipulation**: Zoom, pan, rotate, flip, window/level operations
- **Active Viewport Management**: Track and manage active viewport state
- **State Persistence**: Maintain viewport state across operations
- **Event Callbacks**: Extensible callback system for UI integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track viewport performance metrics

**Key Classes:**
- `ViewportLayout` - Enum defining available layout types
- `ImageManipulation` - Enum defining manipulation operations
- `ViewportState` - Dataclass for viewport state management
- `LayoutConfiguration` - Configuration for viewport layouts
- `ViewportManager` - Main manager class

**Key Methods:**
- `set_layout()` - Switch between viewport layouts
- `apply_image_manipulation()` - Apply zoom, pan, rotate operations
- `load_image_to_viewport()` - Load DICOM image into specific viewport
- `get_layout_info()` - Get current layout and viewport information
- `clear_viewport()` - Clear viewport content and reset state

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Suite
**Test Files Created:**
- `tests/test_dicom_viewport.py` - Full unit and integration tests
- `tests/test_performance.py` - Performance validation tests
- `core_test.py` - Core functionality validation without dependencies

**Test Coverage:**
- DICOM image loading (cached and server-based)
- Viewport layout switching and management
- Image manipulation operations
- Performance characteristics
- Error handling and edge cases
- Concurrent operations
- Memory usage validation
