## üíî The Problem. Our Problem.
This is a story you know. A doctor needs an ultrasound to save a life, but the machine is "end of life." A multi-billion dollar company, like Philips, tells you, "Sorry, we can't offer any services or parts. Please buy a new machine."

The frustration is real. Perfectly good machines are being decommissioned and shipped overseas as e-waste, deemed worthless by corporate mandates. Meanwhile, millions of our loved ones suffer because they cannot afford the systems that are built for profit, not for our people.

This is not a business problem. It's a moral failure of a system that serves those who can pay, while leaving millions of our loved ones behind.

## ‚úä Our Mission. Our Rebellion.
We are a small team of passionate developers who said: **ENOUGH!**

We are building a free, open-source medical system to end this injustice. Ubuntu Patient Care is a comprehensive Radiology Information System (RIS), Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), and medical billing platform.

We are building it to be accessible, maintainable, and ethically sound.

üåç Built for the people: Full offline functionality for clinics in remote areas with unreliable internet access.

üí™ Built on strength: Powered by the open-source excellence of Orthanc, Whisper, and openEMR.

üáøüá¶ Built for our reality: A system deeply tailored for the unique needs of South Africa üáøüá¶, where over 52 million people are excluded from quality healthcare.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why Your Contribution Matters.
We are a small team of four from different countries, united by this purpose. We are fighting a massive, powerful enemy, but we have a secret weapon: **You**.

This isn't just about building software. It's about writing code that's helping to save lives of our loved ones.

**You can be a builder**: Your skills in Python, JavaScript, C++, or PHP can help us refine and expand a system that is saving lives.

**You can be a pioneer**: The world of open-source ML models is evolving. Your ideas can help us integrate the next generation of AI to make our system smarter, faster, and more life-saving.

**You can be a storyteller**: Your voice can amplify our mission. Share your experiences, your challenges, and your victories. Help us spread the word about Ubuntu Patient Care and the impact it's having.

**You can be part of a community**: Whether you're an unemployed person who wants to help with documentation or a seasoned developer, your contribution is invaluable. The more people who contribute, the more we all own this fight. It's the IKEA effect of compassion.

This isn't a one-time effort. It is a continuous rebellion. It is a long, hard fight. But every line of code you contribute, every bug you fix, and every idea you share is a stand against a system that puts profit over our loved ones.

## üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è FOR CLINICIANS - Simple Setup Guide

**This section is for doctors, nurses, radiologists, and clinical staff with no technical background.**

### üéØ What This System Does (In Plain English)

This system has **two main parts** that work together:

1. **üìù Medical Reporting Module** (Port 5443) - Where you dictate reports using your microphone
2. **üñºÔ∏è Image Storage System** (Port 5000) - Where medical images (X-rays, CT scans, etc.) are stored and managed

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Clinician] -->|Speaks into microphone| B[üìù Medical Reporting<br/>Port 5443]

    C -->|Retrieves images| E[(üìÅ NAS Storage)]

    C->>I: 1. Open patient images
    I->>C: Show X-rays/CT scans
    C->>R: 2. Click microphone button
    C->>R: 3. Speak your report
    R->>R: 4. Convert speech to text
    R->>D: 5. Save report
    D->>C: 6. Show completed report
    
    Note over C,D: ‚úÖ Report ready for review
```

### ÔøΩ ONE-CLICK START (Easiest Method)

**For clinicians who want the simplest way:**

1. **Right-click on `START_SYSTEM.ps1`** (in the Orthanc folder)
2. **Select "Run with PowerShell"**
3. **Wait for the green "‚úÖ SYSTEM READY!" message**
4. **That's it!** Open your browser and go to:
   - Medical Reporting: `https://127.0.0.1:5443`
   - Image Storage: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

**To stop:** Press `Ctrl + C` in the PowerShell window or just close it.

---

### ÔøΩüìù Step-by-Step Instructions for Windows (Manual Method)

**Use this if the one-click start doesn't work, or if you want more control.**

#### Part 1: Start the Medical Reporting Module (Voice Dictation)

**What it does:** Lets you dictate medical reports using your microphone.

1. **Open PowerShell** (search for "PowerShell" in Windows start menu)

2. **Navigate to the folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd 'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ELC\Ubuntu-Patient-Care\Orthanc\medical-reporting-module'
   ```

3. **Start the service:**
   ```powershell
   py app.py
   ```

4. **Look for this message:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Running on https://127.0.0.1:5443
   ```

5. **What this means:**
   - ‚úÖ The dictation service is running
   - üåê You can access it at: `https://127.0.0.1:5443`
   - üé§ Your microphone will work here

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Keep this PowerShell window open while you work!

---

#### Part 2: Start the Image Storage System

**What it does:** Manages and displays your medical images (X-rays, CT scans, etc.)

1. **Open a NEW PowerShell window** (don't close the first one!)

2. **Navigate to the folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd 'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ELC\Ubuntu-Patient-Care\Orthanc\orthanc-source\NASIntegration\backend'
   ```

3. **Start the service:**
   ```powershell
   py app.py
   ```

4. **Look for this message:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

5. **What this means:**
   - ‚úÖ The image system is running
   - ÔøΩÔ∏è You can access it at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
   - üìÅ Your images are being managed automatically

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Keep BOTH PowerShell windows open!

---

### üåê Accessing the System

#### Option 1: Local Access (Same Computer)

1. **For Voice Dictation:**
   - Open your browser
   - Go to: `https://127.0.0.1:5443`
   - Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost" (ignore security warning)

2. **For Image Viewing:**
   - Open your browser
   - Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

#### Option 2: Remote Access (From Another Computer or Phone) üåç

**Problem:** Your microphone won't work on HTTP (non-secure) connections.

**Solution:** Use Cloudflare Tunnel to get a secure HTTPS link.

1. **Install Cloudflare Tunnel** (one-time setup):
   ```powershell
   # Download cloudflared
   $dest = "$env:USERPROFILE\cloudflared"
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dest -Force
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe' -OutFile "$dest\cloudflared.exe"
   ```

2. **Start the tunnel:**
   ```powershell
   & "$env:USERPROFILE\cloudflared\cloudflared.exe" tunnel --url "https://127.0.0.1:5443" --no-tls-verify
   ```

3. **Look for this message:**
   ```
   Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at:
   https://random-words-here.trycloudflare.com
   ```

4. **Copy that link** and open it on any device (phone, tablet, another computer)

5. **Your microphone will now work!** ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Problems & Solutions

#### Problem 1: "Port already in use"
**What it means:** The service is already running.

**Solution:**
1. Close the PowerShell window
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Try again

---

#### Problem 2: "Python not found" or "py not found"
**What it means:** Python is not installed.

**Solution:**
1. Download Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. During installation, check ‚úÖ "Add Python to PATH"
3. Restart your computer
4. Try again

---

#### Problem 3: Microphone doesn't work
**What it means:** Browser needs HTTPS for microphone access.

**Solution:**
- Use the Cloudflare Tunnel (see "Option 2: Remote Access" above)
- OR use `https://127.0.0.1:5443` directly (click through security warning)

---

#### Problem 4: Can't access from phone/tablet
**What it means:** Local addresses (127.0.0.1) only work on the same computer.

**Solution:**
- Use Cloudflare Tunnel to get a public HTTPS link (see "Option 2: Remote Access")

---

### üìä System Status - What To Look For

When both services are running correctly, you'll see:

**Medical Reporting Module (PowerShell #1):**
```
‚úÖ Flask extensions initialized
‚úÖ Registered reporting API
‚úÖ Registered voice API
‚úÖ Database tables created successfully
‚úÖ Running on https://127.0.0.1:5443
```

**Image Storage System (PowerShell #2):**
```
‚úÖ Application initialized successfully
‚úÖ NAS‚ÜíOrthanc auto-import service started
‚úÖ Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

If you see these ‚úÖ messages, **everything is working correctly!**

---

### üõë How To Stop The System

1. Go to PowerShell window #1
2. Press `Ctrl + C`
3. Go to PowerShell window #2
4. Press `Ctrl + C`
5. Close both windows

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don't just close the windows!** Always press `Ctrl + C` first to shut down properly.
