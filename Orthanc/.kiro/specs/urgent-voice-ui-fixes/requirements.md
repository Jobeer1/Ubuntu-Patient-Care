# Urgent Voice and UI Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

The medical reporting module has critical issues that are preventing proper functionality. Voice dictation is not working as users speak, the interface lacks South African user-friendly elements, and the layout has excessive empty spaces. This specification addresses these urgent problems to deliver immediate improvements to user experience and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a South African doctor, I want voice dictation to work in real-time as I speak, so that I can efficiently dictate medical reports without delays or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the microphone button THEN the system SHALL immediately start recording and show visual feedback
2. WHEN I speak into the microphone THEN the system SHALL display real-time transcription as I speak, not after I finish
3. WHEN I dictate medical terms THEN the system SHALL recognize South African English pronunciation and medical terminology accurately
4. WHEN the transcription appears THEN it SHALL be inserted into the text area immediately without requiring additional clicks
5. WHEN I pause speaking THEN the system SHALL continue listening and be ready for more input
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and recovery options in both English and Afrikaans
7. WHEN I use voice commands THEN the system SHALL respond to South African medical workflow commands

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a South African medical professional, I want the interface to use South African flag colors and culturally appropriate design elements, so that I feel comfortable and familiar with the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL use South African flag colors (green, gold, red, blue, black, white) as the primary color scheme
2. WHEN I see buttons and interface elements THEN they SHALL incorporate South African medical and cultural design patterns
3. WHEN I read interface text THEN it SHALL use South African English terminology and familiar medical abbreviations
4. WHEN I view icons and graphics THEN they SHALL reflect South African healthcare symbols and cultural elements
5. WHEN I navigate the system THEN the workflow SHALL match South African medical practice patterns
6. WHEN I see branding elements THEN they SHALL incorporate appropriate South African healthcare identity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a doctor using the system, I want the layout to efficiently use screen space without excessive empty areas, so that I can access more information and functions in the available viewport.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the layout SHALL use at least 85% of available screen space effectively
2. WHEN I see cards and panels THEN they SHALL be properly sized with minimal wasted whitespace
3. WHEN I view the voice demo page THEN all controls and feedback areas SHALL be optimally positioned and sized
4. WHEN I resize the browser window THEN the layout SHALL adapt responsively without creating large empty spaces
5. WHEN I view multiple sections THEN they SHALL be organized in a compact, efficient grid layout
6. WHEN I access different features THEN the navigation SHALL be space-efficient and easily accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want immediate visual and audio feedback when using voice features, so that I know the system is working and responding to my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start voice recording THEN the system SHALL show a clear recording indicator with audio level visualization
2. WHEN I speak THEN the system SHALL display real-time audio waveforms or level meters
3. WHEN transcription is processing THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and processing status
4. WHEN transcription completes THEN the system SHALL provide audio confirmation or visual success feedback
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL immediately display error messages with suggested solutions
6. WHEN the microphone is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate recording status with color changes and icons

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a South African doctor, I want the voice recognition to understand my accent and local medical terminology, so that transcription accuracy meets professional standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I dictate in South African English THEN the system SHALL recognize my pronunciation with at least 95% accuracy
2. WHEN I use local medical terms THEN the system SHALL correctly transcribe South African medical terminology and abbreviations
3. WHEN I speak patient names THEN the system SHALL handle South African names and surnames accurately
4. WHEN I dictate measurements THEN the system SHALL correctly format metric measurements used in SA healthcare
5. WHEN I use medical abbreviations THEN the system SHALL expand or maintain SA-standard medical abbreviations
6. WHEN I make corrections THEN the system SHALL learn from my corrections to improve future accuracy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all interface elements to work properly without broken functionality, so that I can complete my medical reporting tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click any button THEN it SHALL respond immediately with the expected action
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN all links and navigation elements SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN I load the voice demo THEN all JavaScript and CSS resources SHALL load without 404 errors

5. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts THEN they SHALL work consistently across all pages
6. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL maintain my session and current state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the system to work reliably without crashes or service failures, so that my workflow is not interrupted during patient care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all services SHALL initialize without critical errors
2. WHEN I use voice features THEN the Whisper service SHALL process audio without timeouts or failures
3. WHEN I access different features THEN the backend services SHALL respond within 2 seconds
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN I work for extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance
6. WHEN I switch between features THEN all transitions SHALL be smooth without service interruptions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a South African healthcare worker, I want the system interface to be intuitive and follow familiar patterns, so that I can use it efficiently without extensive training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first use the system THEN the interface SHALL be immediately familiar to SA healthcare professionals
2. WHEN I look for functions THEN they SHALL be located where SA medical software typically places them
3. WHEN I read labels and instructions THEN they SHALL use terminology familiar to SA medical professionals
4. WHEN I follow workflows THEN they SHALL match standard SA medical practice procedures
5. WHEN I need help THEN the system SHALL provide context-sensitive assistance in SA medical context
6. WHEN I customize settings THEN the options SHALL reflect SA healthcare preferences and standards
