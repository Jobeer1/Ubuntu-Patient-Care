# DICOM Viewer Integration Requirements

## Introduction

The DICOM Viewer Integration addresses the critical gap in the medical reporting system where users currently see a blank screen due to missing DICOM image display capabilities and broken Orthanc server connections. This specification focuses on implementing a functional DICOM viewer with proper Orthanc integration, NAS connectivity, and medical image display capabilities that work immediately upon system startup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Functional DICOM Image Display

**User Story:** As a doctor, I want to see DICOM images immediately when I access the system, so that I can begin my diagnostic work without encountering blank screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the main dashboard THEN I SHALL see a functional DICOM viewer interface with sample images loaded
2. WHEN DICOM images are loaded THEN they SHALL display correctly with proper medical image rendering
3. WHEN no images are available THEN the system SHALL show a clear message with instructions to load images
4. WHEN the viewer loads THEN all essential controls (zoom, pan, window/level) SHALL be immediately accessible
5. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages explaining the connection issue

### Requirement 2: Orthanc Server Connectivity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the medical reporting system to connect successfully to the Orthanc PACS server, so that DICOM images are accessible for reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically attempt connection to the configured Orthanc server
2. WHEN Orthanc connection succeeds THEN the system SHALL display connection status and available studies
3. WHEN Orthanc connection fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN Orthanc is unreachable THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection every 30 seconds
5. WHEN Orthanc authentication is required THEN the system SHALL prompt for credentials and store them securely

### Requirement 3: DICOM Protocol Implementation

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the system to properly handle DICOM protocols and standards, so that medical images are displayed accurately and metadata is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DICOM files are processed THEN they SHALL be parsed according to DICOM 3.0 standards
2. WHEN image metadata is displayed THEN patient information, study details, and technical parameters SHALL be accurate
3. WHEN different DICOM modalities are loaded THEN the viewer SHALL adapt display settings appropriately (CT, MRI, X-Ray, etc.)
4. WHEN DICOM tags are accessed THEN all standard and private tags SHALL be readable
5. WHEN image series are loaded THEN they SHALL be organized and navigable by series and instance numbers

### Requirement 4: NAS Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to access DICOM images stored on NAS devices, so that all available medical images can be viewed and reported on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NAS storage is configured THEN the system SHALL connect to specified network storage locations
2. WHEN DICOM files are stored on NAS THEN they SHALL be accessible through the viewer interface
3. WHEN NAS connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN browsing NAS storage THEN the system SHALL display folder structures and DICOM file listings
5. WHEN NAS authentication is required THEN the system SHALL handle network credentials securely

### Requirement 5: Medical Image Viewer Controls

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want comprehensive image manipulation controls, so that I can properly examine medical images for diagnostic purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing images THEN I SHALL have zoom in/out controls that work smoothly
2. WHEN manipulating images THEN I SHALL have pan functionality for navigating large images
3. WHEN adjusting image display THEN I SHALL have window/level controls for optimal contrast
4. WHEN viewing image series THEN I SHALL have next/previous controls for navigating through slices
5. WHEN measuring features THEN I SHALL have basic measurement tools (distance, angle, area)
6. WHEN comparing images THEN I SHALL be able to display multiple images side by side

### Requirement 6: Multi-Viewport Layout Support

**User Story:** As a doctor, I want to display multiple DICOM images simultaneously in different viewports, so that I can compare studies and make comprehensive diagnostic assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing studies THEN I SHALL be able to create multiple viewports (2x2, 1x2, 1x3 layouts)
2. WHEN arranging viewports THEN I SHALL be able to drag and drop images between viewports
3. WHEN synchronizing viewports THEN I SHALL be able to link zoom, pan, and window/level across multiple images
4. WHEN working with different modalities THEN each viewport SHALL maintain appropriate display settings
5. WHEN saving layouts THEN I SHALL be able to save and restore custom viewport arrangements

### Requirement 7: DICOM Web (DICOMweb) Protocol Support

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the system to support DICOMweb protocols, so that it can communicate with modern PACS systems and web-based medical imaging infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to DICOMweb servers THEN the system SHALL support WADO-RS for image retrieval
2. WHEN searching for studies THEN the system SHALL support QIDO-RS for metadata queries
3. WHEN storing images THEN the system SHALL support STOW-RS for image upload where configured
4. WHEN authenticating with DICOMweb THEN the system SHALL handle OAuth2 and bearer token authentication
5. WHEN handling DICOMweb responses THEN the system SHALL properly parse JSON and multipart responses

### Requirement 8: Offline DICOM Viewing Capability

**User Story:** As a doctor working in areas with unreliable internet, I want to view cached DICOM images offline, so that I can continue diagnostic work during network outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are viewed online THEN they SHALL be automatically cached locally for offline access
2. WHEN the system is offline THEN previously cached images SHALL remain viewable with full functionality
3. WHEN offline mode is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate offline status
4. WHEN network connectivity returns THEN the system SHALL synchronize any offline work
5. WHEN cache storage is full THEN the system SHALL manage cache size using LRU (Least Recently Used) policy

### Requirement 9: Integration with Medical Reporting Workflow

**User Story:** As a doctor, I want the DICOM viewer to integrate seamlessly with the medical reporting interface, so that I can view images while dictating reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating reports THEN the DICOM viewer SHALL be accessible alongside the reporting interface
2. WHEN selecting studies THEN the corresponding images SHALL load automatically in the viewer
