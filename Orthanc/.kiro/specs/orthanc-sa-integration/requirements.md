# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for integrating the South African medical imaging custom modules with the core Orthanc PACS system. The goal is to transform the current dual-system architecture into a unified, plugin-based solution that maintains all SA-specific healthcare features while providing seamless user experience and optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified System Architecture

**User Story:** As a healthcare administrator, I want a single integrated PACS system so that I don't have to manage multiple applications and interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN only one web interface SHALL be accessible to users
2. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL authenticate once for all features
3. WHEN DICOM data is processed THEN all SA-specific features SHALL be available natively
4. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN only one application process SHALL be running the PACS functionality

### Requirement 2: Native Orthanc Plugin Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want SA-specific features implemented as native Orthanc plugins so that performance is optimized and integration is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SA features are accessed THEN they SHALL execute at native Orthanc performance levels
2. WHEN DICOM processing occurs THEN SA compliance checks SHALL be integrated into the pipeline
3. WHEN the system starts THEN SA plugins SHALL be loaded automatically by Orthanc
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN SA endpoints SHALL be available under Orthanc's REST API

### Requirement 3: Unified Database Architecture

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want all system data stored in a synchronized manner so that data integrity is maintained and queries are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patient data is stored THEN it SHALL be accessible from both Orthanc core and SA features
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL not require cross-database joins
3. WHEN data is modified THEN all related systems SHALL see the changes immediately
4. WHEN backups are performed THEN all system data SHALL be included in a single operation

### Requirement 4: Modern Unified Frontend

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want a single modern web interface that includes all PACS and SA-specific features so that my workflow is streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the system THEN I SHALL see one modern React-based interface
2. WHEN I need DICOM viewing THEN the OHIF viewer SHALL be integrated seamlessly
3. WHEN I switch between features THEN the interface SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN I use mobile devices THEN all features SHALL be optimized for touch interaction

### Requirement 5: SA Healthcare Compliance Integration

**User Story:** As a South African healthcare professional, I want HPCSA and POPIA compliance built into the core system so that regulatory requirements are automatically met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access patient data THEN HPCSA validation SHALL be performed automatically
2. WHEN patient data is processed THEN POPIA compliance SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN they SHALL meet SA healthcare regulatory standards
4. WHEN data is shared THEN SA privacy laws SHALL be automatically enforced

### Requirement 6: Multi-language Support Integration

**User Story:** As a South African healthcare worker, I want the system interface in my preferred language (English, Afrikaans, or isiZulu) so that I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a language THEN the entire interface SHALL switch to that language
2. WHEN medical terminology is displayed THEN it SHALL be properly translated
3. WHEN I generate reports THEN they SHALL be available in my selected language
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL detect my browser language preference

### Requirement 7: Seamless Authentication System

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to log in once and access all system features so that my workflow is not interrupted by multiple authentication steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in THEN I SHALL have access to both PACS and SA-specific features
2. WHEN my session expires THEN I SHALL be logged out of all system components
3. WHEN I use 2FA THEN it SHALL work across all system features
4. WHEN I change my password THEN it SHALL update for all system access

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a radiologist, I want the system to perform as fast as native Orthanc so that my diagnostic workflow is not slowed down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load DICOM images THEN they SHALL display at native Orthanc speeds
2. WHEN I search for studies THEN results SHALL appear within 2 seconds
3. WHEN I access SA features THEN they SHALL not introduce noticeable delays
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN performance SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 9: Mobile and Network Optimization

**User Story:** As a South African healthcare worker, I want the system optimized for local network conditions and mobile devices so that I can work effectively in various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use 3G/4G networks THEN the system SHALL adapt image quality automatically
2. WHEN I use mobile devices THEN touch gestures SHALL work intuitively
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL cache data for offline access
4. WHEN load shedding occurs THEN the system SHALL handle power interruptions gracefully

### Requirement 10: Data Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing data and configurations preserved during the integration so that no information is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration is performed THEN all existing DICOM data SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN user accounts are migrated THEN all permissions and settings SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN configurations are updated THEN existing customizations SHALL be preserved where possible
4. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN rollback procedures SHALL be available

### Requirement 11: Plugin Architecture Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SA features implemented as standard Orthanc plugins so that they can be maintained and extended using Orthanc's plugin architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new SA features are needed THEN they SHALL be implementable as Orthanc plugins
2. WHEN Orthanc is updated THEN SA plugins SHALL remain compatible
3. WHEN plugins are distributed THEN they SHALL follow Orthanc plugin standards
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN standard Orthanc debugging tools SHALL work with SA features

### Requirement 12: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage so that the integrated system is reliable and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN all SA features SHALL work with real DICOM data
2. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL meet or exceed current performance
3. WHEN user acceptance testing is done THEN SA healthcare professionals SHALL approve the workflow
4. WHEN regression testing is performed THEN existing Orthanc functionality SHALL remain unaffected
