- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Role-based navigation with admin-specific menus
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Session-based authentication across all interfaces
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: API endpoint testing and validation
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Error handling and user feedback systems

## üöÄ **System Status**

### **Currently Running:**
- **Flask Backend**: http://localhost:5000 (consolidated app.py)
- **React Frontend**: http://localhost:3002 (enhanced interfaces)

### **Available Features:**
1. **Device Management** - Enhanced medical device scanning with DICOM verification
2. **Admin Dashboard** - Real-time system monitoring and statistics
3. **User Management** - Complete user administration interface
4. **Session Authentication** - Secure login with role-based access

### **API Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard/stats` - System statistics
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard/activity` - Recent activity
- `GET /api/admin/users` - User management
- `PUT /api/admin/users/<id>/status` - User status updates
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/<id>` - User deletion
- `POST /api/devices/network/enhanced-scan` - Enhanced device scanning

## üìà **Technical Achievements**

### **Medical Device Detection Improvements:**
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor algorithm considering DICOM ports, manufacturer detection, hostname analysis
- **DICOM Verification**: Real-time C-ECHO testing to verify medical device capabilities
- **Enhanced UI**: Color-coded confidence indicators, detailed device information display
- **Manufacturer Detection**: MAC address OUI lookup and hostname parsing

### **Admin Dashboard Enhancements:**
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live system health and device status
- **User Analytics**: Active sessions, total users, device statistics
- **Quick Actions**: One-click access to network scanning and user management
- **Professional Design**: Modern, responsive interface optimized for healthcare workflows

### **Backend Consolidation Benefits:**
- **Single Entry Point**: All APIs accessible through main app.py
- **Simplified Deployment**: Easier to deploy and maintain
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Unified error responses across all endpoints
- **Better Performance**: Reduced overhead and improved response times
