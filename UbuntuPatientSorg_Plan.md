## Secure Active Directory Integration & User Management for PACS

### Goals
- Integrate a robust, efficient, and accurate Active Directory (AD) or LDAP system with Orthanc PACS for user authentication and access control.
- Make user and access management extremely easy for admins, but with strong security (multi-factor authentication, role-based access, audit logging).
- Ensure only authorized users can access patient data and images, with all actions logged for POPI compliance.
- Images should be rendered using host/user resources (client-side rendering) to optimize performance and privacy.
- Reports must be attached to images in the PACS, and sharing must be possible via secure, expiring links so patients can only access their own images and reports.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Active Directory/LDAP Integration**
  - Integrate Orthanc PACS with AD/LDAP for single sign-on (SSO) and centralized user management.
  - Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin and clinical users.
  - Map AD groups to system roles (admin, radiologist, transcriptionist, billing, patient).
2. **User & Access Management**
  - Build or configure an admin UI for adding/removing users, assigning roles, and setting access to patient data.
  - All changes to users/roles are logged and require MFA for approval.
  - Provide easy bulk user import (CSV/Excel) for onboarding.
3. **Image Rendering**
  - Use client-side rendering (e.g., Cornerstone.js) for DICOM images in the viewer, leveraging the user's device for performance and privacy.
  - Ensure server never sends images to unauthorized users; all access is checked against AD roles.
4. **Secure Report Attachment & Sharing**
  - Attach finalized reports to DICOM studies in Orthanc.
  - Generate secure, expiring links for patients to view only their own images and reports (one-time access, strong encryption, audit logging).
  - Optionally, allow doctors to share images/reports with referring physicians via secure links.
5. **Compliance & Audit**
  - All access and sharing actions are logged for POPI Act compliance.
  - Regularly review access logs and test for unauthorized access.

### Success Criteria
- Admins can easily and securely manage users and access rights.
- Only authorized users can access patient data and images.
- Images are rendered efficiently on user devices.
- Patients can securely access only their own images and reports via expiring links.
- All actions are logged and system passes compliance review.
## Real-World Reporting & Billing Workflow (South African Radiology)

### Reporting & Authorisation
1. **Doctor Dictation:** Doctor creates a report using voice dictation (STT) or keyboard in the reporting module.
2. **Transcription Review:** The draft report is sent to a team of three transcriptionists who review and correct the STT output for medical accuracy and terminology, especially for complex South African medical terms.
3. **Doctor Proofreading & Authorisation:** The corrected report is sent back to the doctor for final proofreading and digital authorisation/sign-off.
4. **Billing Team Processing:** Once authorised, the report is sent to the billing team to assign fees and submit claims to medical schemes, ensuring compliance with local billing codes and requirements.

This workflow ensures high-quality, accurate reports and proper billing, tailored for South African radiology practice. All steps are logged for audit and POPI compliance.
